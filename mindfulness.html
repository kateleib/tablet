        <h1>MINDFULNESS</h1>
        <p>Yoga develops inner awareness. It focuses your attention on your body's abilities at the present moment. It helps develop breath and strength of mind and body. It's not about physical appearance.</p>
        <p>Practicing yoga has been shown to increase mindfulness not just in class, but in other areas of a person's life.</p>
        <img src = "mindful.jpeg" alt= "mindfulness meditation">
        <p>Yoga is not about being the most flexible person in the room. Rather, the only responsibility is to be and to breathe. By focusing on breath and movement, yoga creates the ability to be present in the here and now.</p>
